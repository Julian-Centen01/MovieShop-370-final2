There are only two files in this folder that matter
- The FXML file which had the start of what the GUI was going to look like.
- The Java Controller file

Now something about the Controller that is important, it no longer points towards the given FXML file. Once I figured out that 
it was not going to be able to be implemented I started to just use what I had in that project for another class, but the 
functionality is the same so I included it anyway. 
I worked very hard on this project and don't want it to not show.
I also might include the database connection java file that way I can show you it did have that functionality with my 
personal MySQL.
